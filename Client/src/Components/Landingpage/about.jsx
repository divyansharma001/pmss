        PMSSS stands for Prime Minister's Special Scholarship Scheme. It's a
        government scheme designed to provide financial assistance to students
        from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) to pursue undergraduate studies outside the
        state. The aim is to enhance employment opportunities and improve the
        educational prospects of youth from J&K.   The scholarship covers
        tuition fees, hostel charges, and other expenses related to the
